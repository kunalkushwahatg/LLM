william shakespeare
hill whose concave womb reworded plaintful story sistring vale spirits tattend double voice accorded laid list sadtuned tale ere long espied fickle maid full pale tearing papers breaking rings atwain storming world sorrows wind rain
upon head platted hive straw fortified visage sun whereon thought might think sometime saw carcase beauty spent done time scythed youth begun youth quit spite heavens fell rage beauty peeped lattice seared age
oft heave napkin eyne conceited characters laundring silken figures brine seasoned woe pelleted tears often reading contents bears often shrieking undistinguished woe clamours size high low
sometimes levelled eyes carriage ride battry spheres intend sometime diverted poor balls tied th orbed earth sometimes extend view right anon gazes lend every place nowhere fixed mind sight distractedly commixed
hair loose tied formal plat proclaimed careless hand pride untucked descended sheaved hat hanging pale pined cheek beside threaden fillet still bide true bondage would break thence though slackly braided loose negligence
thousand favours maund drew amber crystal beaded jet one one river threw upon whose weeping margent set like usury applying wet wet monarchs hands lets bounty fall want cries excess begs
folded schedules many one perused sighed tore gave flood cracked many ring posied gold bone bidding find sepulchres mud found yet moe letters sadly penned blood sleided silk feat affectedly enswathed sealed curious secrecy
often bathed fluxive eyes often kissed often gan tear cried false blood thou register lies unapproved witness dost thou bear ink would seemed black damned said top rage lines rents big discontents breaking contents
reverend man grazed cattle nigh sometime blusterer ruffle knew court city let go swiftest hours observed flew towards afflicted fancy fastly drew privileged age desires know brief grounds motives woe
slides upon grained bat comely distant sits side desires sat grievance hearing divide may aught applied may suffering ecstasy assuage tis promised charity age
father says though behold injury many blasting hour let tell judgement old age sorrow hath power might yet spreading flower fresh selfapplied love love beside
woe early attended youthful suit gain grace one natures outwards commended maidens eyes stuck face love lacked dwelling made place fair parts abide new lodged newly deified
browny locks hang crooked curls every light occasion wind upon lips silken parcels hurls whats sweet aptly find eye saw enchant mind visage little drawn largeness thinks paradise sawn
small show man yet upon chin phoenix began appear like unshorn velvet termless skin whose bare outbragged web seemed wear yet showed visage cost dear nice affections wavering stood doubt best best without
qualities beauteous form maidentongued thereof free yet men moved storm oft twixt may april see winds breathe sweet unruly though rudeness authorized youth livery falseness pride truth
well could ride often men would say horse mettle rider takes proud subjection noble sway rounds bounds course stop makes controversy hence question takes whether horse became deed manage th welldoing steed
quickly side verdict went real habitude gave life grace appertainings ornament accomplished case aids made fairer place came additions yet purposed trim pierced grace graced
tip subduing tongue kind arguments question deep replication prompt reason strong advantage still wake sleep make weeper laugh laugher weep dialect different skill catching passions craft
general bosom reign young old sexes enchanted dwell thoughts remain personal duty following haunted consents bewitched ere desire granted dialogued would say asked wills made wills obey
many picture get serve eyes put mind like fools th imagination set goodly objects abroad find lands mansions thought assigned labouring moe pleasures bestow true gouty landlord doth owe
many never touched hand sweetly supposed mistress heart woeful self freedom stand feesimple part art youth youth art threw affections charmed power reserved stalk gave flower
yet equals demand desired yielded finding honour forbid safest distance mine honour shielded experience many bulwarks builded proofs newbleeding remained foil false jewel amorous spoil
ah ever shunned precedent destined ill must assay forced examples gainst content put bypast perils way counsel may stop awhile stay rage advice often seen blunting us make wills keen
gives satisfaction blood must curb upon others proof forbod sweets seems good fear harms preach behoof appetite judgement stand aloof one palate hath needs taste though reason weep cry thy last
could say mans untrue knew patterns foul beguiling heard plants others orchards grew saw deceits gilded smiling knew vows ever brokers defiling thought characters words merely art bastards foul adulterate heart
long upon terms held city till thus gan besiege gentle maid suffering youth feeling pity holy vows afraid thats ye sworn none ever said feasts love called unto till neer invite never woo
offences abroad see errors blood none mind love made acture may neither party true kind sought shame shame find much less shame remains much reproach contains
among many mine eyes seen one whose flame heart much warmed affection put th smallest teen leisures ever charmed harm done neer harmed kept hearts liveries mine free reigned commanding monarchy
look tributes wounded fancies sent paled pearls rubies red blood figuring passions likewise lent grief blushes aptly understood bloodless white encrimsoned mood effects terror dear modesty encamped hearts fighting outwardly
lo behold talents hair twisted metal amorously empleached receivd many several fair kind acceptance weepingly beseeched annexions fair gems enriched deepbrained sonnets amplify stones dear nature worth quality
diamond twas beautiful hard whereto invised properties tend deepgreen emrald whose fresh regard weak sights sickly radiance amend heavenhued sapphire opal blend objects manifold several stone wit well blazoned smiled made moan
lo trophies affections hot pensived subdued desires tender nature hath charged hoard yield must render origin ender force must oblations since altar enpatron
advance phraseless hand whose white weighs airy scale praise take similes command hallowed sighs burning lungs raise minister obeys works audit comes distract parcels combined sums
lo device sent nun sister sanctified holiest note late noble suit court shun whose rarest havings made blossoms dote sought spirits richest coat kept cold distance thence remove spend living eternal love
sweet labour ist leave thing mastring strives playing place form receive playing patient sports unconstrained gyves fame contrives scars battle scapeth flight makes absence valiant might
pardon boast true accident brought eye upon moment force subdue would caged cloister fly religious love put religions eye tempted would immured tempt liberty procured
mighty hear tell broken bosoms belong emptied fountains well mine pour ocean among strong oer oer strong must victory us congest compound love physic cold breast

thou impressest precepts worth stale example thou wilt inflame coldly impediments stand forth wealth filial fear law kindred fame loves arms peace gainst rule gainst sense gainst shame sweetens suffring pangs bears aloes forces shocks fears
hearts mine depend feeling break bleeding groans pine supplicant sighs extend leave battry make gainst mine lending soft audience sweet design credent soul strongbonded oath shall prefer undertake troth
said watry eyes dismount whose sights till levelled face cheek river running fount brinish current downward flowed apace channel stream gave grace glazed crystal gate glowing roses flame water hue encloses
father hell witchcraft lies small orb one particular tear inundation eyes rocky heart water wear breast cold warmed cleft effect cold modesty hot wrath fire hence chill extincture hath
lo passion art craft even resolved reason tears white stole chastity daffed shook sober guards civil fears appear appears melting though drops diffrence bore poisoned mine restore
plenitude subtle matter applied cautels strange forms receives burning blushes weeping water swooning paleness takes leaves eithers aptness best deceives blush speeches rank weep woes turn white swoon tragic shows
heart level came could scape hail allhurting aim showing fair nature kind tame veiled win would maim thing sought would exclaim burned heartwished luxury preached pure maid praised cold chastity
thus merely garment grace naked concealed fiend covered th unexperient gave tempter place like cherubin hovered young simple would lovered ay fell yet question make sake
